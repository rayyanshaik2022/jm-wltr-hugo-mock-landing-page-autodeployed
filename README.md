# hugo-mock-landing-page

A static landing page with custom formatting for an educational platform, **Connected Neurons**, built using Hugo for **CIS 3500**.

## About Connected Neurons
Connected Neurons was a website I created during high school but unfortunately lost over time. This project is a small recreation of it, with a modern design and improved formatting (in my opinion).
