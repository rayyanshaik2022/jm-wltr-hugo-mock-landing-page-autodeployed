<h1 id="fun-fact-why-the-speed-of-light-has-no-decimals-and-the-history-of-the-meter">[Fun Fact] Why the Speed of Light Has No Decimals and the History of the Meter</h1>
<p>Have you ever wondered why the speed of light in a vacuum is exactly <strong>299,792,458 m/s</strong>? How can such a precise and complicated number have no decimals? To answer this question, we need to dive into the fascinating history of how the meter was defined.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-meter-">The Origins of the Meter 📏</h2>
<p>In <strong>1793</strong>, the meter was defined by the International System of Units as exactly <strong>one ten-millionth of the distance</strong> between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian. By <strong>1879</strong>, this distance was represented using a <strong>platinum-iridium alloy bar</strong> with marks on each side to denote one meter.</p>
<p>However, there was a problem: this physical bar was stored in the <strong>International Bureau of Weights and Measures</strong> in Sèvres, France, and not everyone could access it to calibrate instruments. The need for a better, more universal definition was clear.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="redefining-the-meter-with-waves-">Redefining the Meter with Waves 🌊</h2>
<p>In <strong>1960</strong>, scientists decided to redefine some units based on the <strong>frequencies and wavelengths</strong> of certain radiations. The meter was then set as <strong>1,650,763.73 wavelengths</strong> of orange-red light emitted by krypton-86 in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Later, the second was also redefined in <strong>1967</strong>, using the frequency of radiation emitted by cesium-133. (Before this, a second was defined as <strong>1/86,400 of a mean solar day</strong>, which caused inconsistencies.)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-modern-definition-">The Modern Definition ⚡</h2>
<p>To achieve even greater precision, the definition of the meter changed again: it became the <strong>distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 seconds in a vacuum</strong>. This was possible because:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The speed of light is constant in a vacuum.</strong></li>
<li>This constancy is supported by Einstein’s <strong>special theory of relativity</strong>, which postulates that the speed of light does not change based on time, location, or observer movement.</li>
</ol>
<p>While it may seem counterintuitive, this definition is both logical and universally consistent, as long as we specify that it applies in a vacuum.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-no-decimals-">Why No Decimals? 🤔</h2>
<p>The reason the speed of light has no decimals lies in the fact that <strong>our definition of the meter depends on it</strong>, not the other way around. Technically, we could have chosen any whole-number value, such as <strong>300,000,000 m/s</strong>, but that would have required changing the definition of the meter.</p>
<p>This means the number <strong>299,792,458 m/s</strong> isn&rsquo;t arbitrary—it’s directly tied to the structure of our system of measurements.</p>
